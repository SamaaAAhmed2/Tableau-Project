Marketing Performance Analysis via an Interactive Dashboard


Marketing Performance Analysis via an Interactive Dashboard

Over the past period, I have been working on designing and analysing an interactive marketing dashboard to track and evaluate the performance of campaigns across various channels. The results, as illustrated below, provide clear and actionable insights.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Analyzed in the Dashboard:

1. Number Of Clicks
2. Acquisition Cost
3. Conversion Rate
4. Engagement Score
5. Impressions

 Marketing Channel Analysis:
- Social Media and Influencers: These channels generated the highest ROI, showcasing strong visibility.
- Foodies and Tech Both demonstrated comparable performance in terms of engagement levels.

Objective:
The primary goal of this analysis is to optimize budget allocation across channels, identify campaigns with the highest returns, and gain insights based on geographic regions, campaign types, and target audience segments.

Key Insight:
Leveraging Tableau for this analysis transformed raw data into clear, actionable visualisations, enabling faster and more accurate decision-making.

This dashboard enables stakeholders to make informed, data-driven decisions, ensuring that marketing efforts are both efficient and impactful.
